# Bedside Companion Project

## Vision

The Bedside Companion is a web-based application designed to provide a simple, elegant interface for controlling bedside ambiance through webhooks. It allows users to control music playback and lighting through a beautiful web interface or via simple webhook calls, making it perfect for integration with smart home systems, voice assistants, or custom hardware controllers.

# Project Name

*This is a Concrete-powered project. Concrete helps bring structure to your vision and enables AI to more effectively assist in development.*

## Project Overview

*[This section will be filled with your project vision and goals as they develop through our conversations.]*

## Concrete Structure

This project uses the Concrete system to provide structure and guidance. Here's how it works:

### Folders

- **`.concrete/`**: The Concrete system for this project
  - **`conversations/`**: Summaries of our important discussions
  - **`ideation/`**: Your thoughts, brainstorming, and vision documents
  - **`guides/`**: Step-by-step guides for project milestones (will be created as needed)

### Files

- **`README.md`**: This file - the central documentation for your project
- **`tracking.md`**: Progress tracking and next steps
- **`system-prompt.md`**: Guidelines for the AI assistant (you don't need to modify this)

## How to Share Your Vision

There are two main ways to share your ideas and vision for this project:

1. **Direct conversation**: Simply chat with the AI assistant about your ideas, and they will help refine and structure them.

2. **Ideation documents**: For more complex or detailed thoughts, create a document in the `.concrete/ideation/` folder. The AI will read these documents and help you develop your ideas.

## Getting Started

1. **Share your vision**: Tell the AI assistant about your project idea, or create an ideation document.

2. **Refine the project structure**: Work with the AI to define the project structure, milestones, and goals.

3. **Track progress**: Use the tracking.md file to monitor progress and plan next steps.

4. **Save important conversations**: When you have important discussions with the AI, they will offer to save summaries in the conversations folder.
